# JIT account provisioning with SAML

Clerk supports Just-in-Time (JIT) account provisioning for all supported SAML providers out of the box. This feature is available for all new Clerk applications by default, and can be used with any Clerk app that has the **[Sync user attributes during Sign in](/docs/authentication/saml/overview#sync-user-attributes-during-sign-in)** setting enabled.

The following is a list of guides for enabling JIT account provisioning with some popular SAML providers:

- [Azure (Microsoft Entra ID)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/use-scim-to-provision-users-and-groups)
- [Google Workspace](https://support.google.com/a/topic/6400789?sjid=9603485614154557114-AP)
- [Okta](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-add-users-jit.htm)

## Should I use JIT provisioning with Clerk?

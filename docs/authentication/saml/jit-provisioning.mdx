# JIT account provisioning with SAML

Just-in-Time (JIT) account provisioning, or automatic account provisioning, is a process by which accounts for employees are created on-demand when they sign-up to an app with SAML using a company email address. Using this feature means your IT department won't have to manually create user accounts for each of the services or apps your employees use to get work done.

Consider using JIT account provisioning if you don't need to control who accesses your Clerk application on a case-by-case basis.

Clerk supports JIT account provisioning for all [supported SAML providers](/docs/pr/1038/authentication/saml/overview) out of the box. This feature is available for any Clerk app that has the **[Sync user attributes during Sign in](/docs/authentication/saml/overview#sync-user-attributes-during-sign-in)** setting enabled, which is all Clerk apps by default.

The following is a list of guides for enabling JIT account provisioning with some popular SAML providers:
